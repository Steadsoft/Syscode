# Type Conversion

## Expressions

Expressions that involve only numeric types obey rules as to how the operation and operand types are used to determine a result's type.

The default for arithmetic operators when both operands are the same type, is that the result has that same type.

So `bin8` + `bin8` yields a `bin8` result.

If the type are not the same then the result type is the same as the largest of the two operand types.

So `bin8 * `bin32` yields a `bin32` result.

The same rule is applied even for types that are not an integral number of bytes.

So `bin(11)` * `bin(6)` yields a `bin(11)` result.
